ideas:
What i dont like most in modern react and react-like frameworks:
need for mixed up in your code: 
  view of visual elements: size, font, color, etc.
  behaviour logic: event handlers 
  layout logic: i hate that most, there are  so many diferent ways for layout your elements: flex, grid, style library wrappers for grid   and flex like Grid component in Material-ui.  
  
What i like in react: 
  way of doing changes in ui: no for directly calling methods of ui-elements, for any changes your must change of state and smart
  framework doing all next job for you
